4.1 Introduction
For the details of how globbing works, you can view the man page on glob in section 7 of the manual pages by executing:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ man 7 glob

4.2 Asterisk * Character
The asterisk* wildcard can be used to match any string, including the empty string.

sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo *

echo D*n*

4.3 Question Mark ? Character
The question mark ? character in a string will match exactly one character.

sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo ??
‌⁠​​⁠​ du ex hd id nl od pg pr sg tr ul vi wc xz
sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo ???
a2p apt awk cal cmp col cut dig env eqn

echo w??*

4.4 Brackets [ ] Characters
By using the square bracket [ ] characters, a set of characters can be enclosed that will be used to match exactly one character. You can think of the square brackets as being like a question mark ? wildcard, but limited to the characters that are listed inside of the square brackets.

For example, using a pattern like [abcd]?? will match file names that start with an a, b, c, or d character and that are three characters long. Alternatively, letters that are consecutive can also be expressed as a range like the [a-d]?? pattern:

sysadmin@localhost:/usr/bin$ echo [a-d]??
a2p apt awk cal cmp col cut dig

echo [!a-v]*
